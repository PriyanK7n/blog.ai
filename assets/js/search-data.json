            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. . Example 1: DropDown . # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) .

And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

            "content": "My First Post: Setting tone for this blog . . There’s always an awesome list for X. . Don&#39;t reinvent the wheel is something you’ll hear a lot in the field of technology. That means, whenever possible, try to use existing tools out there instead of building from scratch. If you use GitHub long enough, you probably already know this: for almost everything you’d like to learn, there’s an awesome list for that, which collects all sorts of awesome resources, including tools and tutorials. All you need to do is search for awesome X on GitHub. Or better yet, there’s even a meta list of awesome lists on various topics, like sindresorhus/awesome. Included in it is an awesome list for linguistics, theimpossibleastronaut/awesome-linguistics, which is a good place to start learning about natural language processing (NLP) if you are a humanities major who knows nothing about programming, as I was about one year ago. To take one more example, I wish I had discovered keon/awesome-nlp much earlier, which could’ve saved me lots of time when I was still fumbling around and trying to wrap my head around how a tool, say gensim, fits into the broader picture of NLP. But sometimes the name of an awesome list doesn’t have the keyword awesome in it, such as this gem ivan-bilan/The-NLP-Pandect. In my opinion, although an awesome list by any other name would be as awesome, the The-NLP-Pandect repo would have got much more stars if awesome were in its name. . But the hardest part is to get the ball rolling. . However, awesome as they are, awesome lists can be quite intimidating to go through and easy to get lost in. And even when you are lucky enough to finally come across an awesome tool that you wanna try out, it sometimes takes lots of trials and errors to figure out the right way to get the ball rolling, especially when you are a fresh programmer. So on this blog, I plan to add my personal touch to various tools, documenting not only what I did right to get the ball rolling, but also what I did wrong to save you (or even future me) from abysmal frustration. For almost every tool, there is already a wide specturum of instructional documents available online, ranging from hardcore official documentations to professional posts on platforms like Medium. And this blog is meant to be a friendly complement to those. I’ll be writing in plain language because I was not trained for computer science or programming anyway. . The fast stack . I’d like to start with a series of tools that I dub the fast stack, including fastpages, fast.ai, fastText, and fastAPI. Designed by the fast.ai team, fastpages is basically a template for creating a blog (like this one!) and does lots of awesome things for you hehind the scenes. Features that I like about it include: . automatically converts .md and .ipynb files on GitHub to posts on your website | automatically adds links to Colab and GitHub | shows interactive visualizations of the output of codes | supports comments | is free from end to end | . Truth be told that I actually failed twice before I successfully set up this blog. The lesson learned is this: do exactly what’s said on the instructions! Humanities majors like me are often taught to be creative, but be sure to leave your creativity at the door when you set up computer programs. This then concludes my first repo. Nothing is super technical here since it’s just a warm-up. I’ll save other tools in the fast stack for another day. . . I was clueless when I read PR in the instructions. It turns out to mean &#39;pull requests&#39;. Click on the tab that says &#39;pull requests&#39; when you are done forking the original repo. Then you&#39;re good to go by following the instructions there.",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
