My name is Haowen Jiang. I got a PhD of linguistics from [Rice University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_University) and spent most of my early career in academia doing *theoretical* research on indigenous languages of Taiwan, all of them related to languages such as Tagalog and Malay/Indonesian. Then along came COVID-19, which disrupted most people's lives, including mine. Somehow I became a machine learning engineer, working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other AI-related *applicational* stuff.
