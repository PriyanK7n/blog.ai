Welcome to my blog, which documents a linguist's learning journey to the world of AI and Python programming! My given name sounds just like two question words, `how` and `when`. So, what's covered here includes the **hows** for getting AI jobs done and **whens** for using the right tools created by the almighty open source community. This blog is basically a collection of my own learning records, which might be helpful to you if you are a newbie like me, chasing rabbits in the AI world. Mind you, I was trained for linguistics, not computer science or programming. What I'm offering is simply AI through a linguist's looking glass.
