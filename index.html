Welcome to my first blog hosted on GitHub and built with `fastpages` [^1]. My given name sounds just like two question words, `how` and `when`, which explains the `hownwhendunit.ai` part of the URL for this blog. Another reason is that I'm a big fan of detective fiction, where `howdunit` is a genre focusing on **how** the perpetrator has committed a crime. But rest assured that no crime will be covered on this blog. Rather, it will document the **hows** for getting AI jobs done and **whens** for using the right tools created by the almighty open source community. This blog is basically a collection of my personal learning records, which might be helpful to you if you are a newbie like me, chasing rabbits in the world of AI and Python programming. Mind you, I was trained for linguistics, not computer science or programming. So be sure to use caution when reading my posts, which will be coming soon. 

[^1]: Designed by the awesome team at `fastai`, [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) is an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
